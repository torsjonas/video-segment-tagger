A tool for quickly creating a list of video segments by pinball maneuver type, e.g. the moments when a player makes a live catch, post pass etc. Export the list as a CSV file for further processing.

The application does not require any installation since it runs in the browser. It is available here: https://torsjonas.github.io/video-segment-tagger/

Using the app.
1. Select a video url and play the video forward, pause, rewind etc to find the moment just at the start of a pinball move.
2. Pause the video at the start of the move and then click the save icon. 
3. Then play the video further until the moment when the pinball move is considered done and pause the video again. Click the save icon. 
4. When you are happy with the start and end time, click save icon to save the video segment into the list at the bottom.

You can repeat the above process to create a list of many pinball moves found in selected videos. The list of segments is found at the bottom of the application. Make sure to download the list as a CSV file so that you don't loose your segments.
